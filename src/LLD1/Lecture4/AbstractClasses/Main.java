    1. It's a class that cannot be instantiated.
    2. Animal class is a good example
    3. Animal is nothing but an abstract concept
    4. You would create objects of Dog, Cat, Bird


    Key Properties of Abstract Classes:
    1. Declare with an abstract keyword
    2. Can have both abstract methods and concrete methods(with a full implementation)
    3. Can have constructors, instance variables and static variables
    4. A class can only extend one abstract class


    Abstract class establishes "is-a" relationship
